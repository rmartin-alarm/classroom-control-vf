  <h1>Cuban Pete</h1>
  <h2> Verse 1 (Male Solo) </h2>
  <pre>
They call me Cuban Pete. I'm the king of the rhumba beat.
When I play the maracas I go chick-chicky-boom, chick-chicky boom
Yes sir, I'm Cuban Pete. I'm the craze of my native street.
When I start to dance, everything goes chick-chicky-boom, chick-chicky boom

The senoritas they sing and how they swing with this rumbero,
It's very nice, so full of spice.
And when they're dancing they bring a happy ring the maraquero,
El maraquero singin' a song, all the day long.
  </pre>

  <h2> Chorus </h2>
  <pre>
So if you like the beat, take a lesson from Cuban Pete
And I'll teach you to chick-chicky-boom, chick-chicky-boom.
  </pre>

  <h2> Bridge (Female Solo) </h2>

  <pre>
He's really a modest guy, although he's the hottest guy
In Havana, in Havana.
  </pre>

  <h2> Verse 2 (Male Solo) </h2>

  <pre>
Si, senorita I know that you would like to chicky-boom-chick
It's very nice, so full of spice.
I'll place my hand on your hip, and if you will just give me your hand
Then we shall try - just you and I. Aye-aye-aye!
  
So if you like the beat, take a lesson from Cuban Pete
And I'll teach you chick-chicky-boom, chick-chicky-boom, chick-chicky-boom

Shake Your Booty, Daddy, Wow!
See ya!
